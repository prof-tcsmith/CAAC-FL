# Claude Code Guidelines for This Project

## Markdown List Formatting Rules

**CRITICAL**: When writing markdown lists in .qmd or .md files, you MUST include a blank line before the list UNLESS the line immediately before is a header (starting with #, ##, ###, etc.).

### Rule

```markdown
# This is OK - header directly before list
- Item 1
- Item 2

This is a paragraph ending with a colon:
- Item 1  ❌ WRONG - will render as single line
- Item 2

This is a paragraph ending with a colon:

- Item 1  ✅ CORRECT - blank line before list
- Item 2
```

### Common Patterns to Fix

1. **After descriptive text ending with colon**:
   ```markdown
   The following options are available:

   - Option 1
   - Option 2
   ```

2. **After inline text**:
   ```markdown
   Consider these factors:

   1. Factor one
   2. Factor two
   ```

3. **After mathematical expressions**:
   ```markdown
   Given the equation $x = y$:

   - Case 1
   - Case 2
   ```

### When Blank Line is NOT Needed

- Immediately after headers (any level: #, ##, ###, etc.)
- Inside code blocks
- After other list items (continuing the same list)

## Git Commit Messages

- Never include AI attribution (Claude, Claude Code, etc.)
- Focus on technical changes and outcomes
- Keep commit messages professional and concise

## Federated Learning Experiment Conventions

- Use seed=42 for reproducibility
- Document all experimental configurations in JSON format
- Create comprehensive analysis scripts for multi-level experiments
- Always check for failed experiments (stuck at random chance accuracy)
